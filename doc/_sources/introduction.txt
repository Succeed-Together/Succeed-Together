Introduction
============

Bakfu is a toolkit based (mostly) on `scikit-learn`_.

It is meant to be a practical tool able to fetch data and use external librairies in an easy and streamlined way.

If you want to dive into the subject you should check out the :ref:`quickstart`.

.. note::
    The librairy is still far from complete.


.. note::
    The documentation is (also) still far from complete.



Core concepts
----------------

The library is structured around a toolchain approach.
You start by creating a Chain, and add processing steps to it : data loading, tagging, clustering ...

Creating a chain 
___________________


To create a new chain :
::
    baf = bakfu.Chain(lang='en')

The lang parameter chooses the language.
Supported languages : **en**, **fr**.


Loading and accessing data
_______________

Raw data can be load as follow :
::
    data = [
        (0, 'test'),
        (1, 'test 2'),
        (2, 'test 3')
        ]
    baf.load('data.simple', data)    

To get the last dataset loaded without indexes :
::
    baf.get_chain("data_source").get_data()



To list all exlicitely loaded datasets : 
::
    baf.data_sources

.. note::
    Some processors that transform data embed their own dataset containing processed data.
